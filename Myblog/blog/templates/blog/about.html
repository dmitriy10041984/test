        About Us
    </h1>
    <p>The purpose of Linux Mint is to produce a modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use.</p>
    <p>Linux Mint is the most popular desktop Linux distribution and the 3rd most widely used home operating system behind Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS.</p>
    <p>Some of the reasons for the success of Linux Mint are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It works out of the box, with full multimedia support and is extremely easy to use.</li>
      <li>It's both free of cost and open source.</li>
      <li>It's community-driven. Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Linux Mint.</li>
      <li>Based on Debian and Ubuntu, it provides about 30,000 packages and one of the best software managers.</li>
      <li>It's safe and reliable. Thanks to a conservative approach to software updates, a unique Update Manager and the robustness of its Linux architecture, Linux Mint requires very little maintenance (no regressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware...etc).</li>
    </ul>
